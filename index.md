# Abstract
The financial world of equity trading relies on centralized exchanges. These exchanges are disseminated around the globe.
Thus, it is sometimes possible to trade a share of one given company in multiple regions. Abitrage pricing theory tells us that the price on those exchanges should roughly be equivalent. However, bcause information speed is bounded, shocks on a given share price might take some time to reach all exchanges and be incorporated into the new stock prices.
